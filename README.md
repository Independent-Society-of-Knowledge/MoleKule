# Molekule: Molecular Dynamics Toolkit

Molekule is a comprehensive, open-source toolkit designed to streamline the process of preparing, visualizing, running, and post-processing Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations. Developed by the lead director @Nort3x and driven by the community, Molekule aims to provide an integrated environment that empowers researchers and enthusiasts alike.

## Features

- **Integrated Environment**: Molekule offers an idiomatic, all-in-one platform that consolidates various tasks involved in MD and DFT simulations, enhancing productivity and workflow efficiency.

- **Snapshots**: Molekule automatically captures snapshots of each simulation, enabling easy tracking and reproducibility of results.

- **Scalability**: The toolkit is designed to be scalable, allowing users to seamlessly scale their simulations across different computing resources.

- **Extensibility**: Built with a clean, modular architecture, Molekule encourages extensibility and reusability, empowering users to customize and expand its functionality to suit their specific needs.

- **Procedural Generation**: Leveraging the power of the Kotlin programming language, Molekule enables users to procedurally generate initial configurations for MD simulations with unparalleled flexibility.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Despite its robust capabilities, Molekule boasts a remarkably user-friendly interface, requiring only a quick review of straightforward examples to grasp its core functionality.

- **Community-Driven**: As an open-source project, Molekule benefits from the collective wisdom and contributions of a thriving community, fostering continuous refinement and expansion of its codebase.
